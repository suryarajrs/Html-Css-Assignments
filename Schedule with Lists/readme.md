## Task List Using HTML Lists

You are tired of not being able to complete your tasks on time. This time, you decide to make a list of all the tasks you want to accomplish in a day. Using **HTML Lists**, you'll create three different lists: an **Ordered List**, an **Unordered List**, and a **Descriptive List**.

### Ordered List
- The `id` for this list is `#ordered-parent`.
- The list items will be **numbered with uppercase letters**.
- The list contains the following four items:
  1. Get up in the morning
  2. Shopping
  3. Newton School Assignment
  4. Dinner

- The **Shopping** item contains a **nested ordered list**:
  - The nested list has an `id` of `#ordered-child`.
  - Its items will be **numbered with lowercase letters** and include:
    - Groceries
    - Drinks

### Unordered List
- The `id` for this list is `#unordered-parent`.
- The list contains the following three items:
  - Coffee
  - Fruits
  - Milk

- The **Fruits** item contains a **nested unordered list**:
  - The nested list has an `id` of `#unordered-child`.
  - It contains:
    - Banana
    - Pineapple

### Descriptive List
- The `id` for this list is `#descriptive-list`.
- It contains description terms and their corresponding data:
  - **Black Drink**
    - Coca Cola
    - Pepsi
  - **Orange Drink**
    - Mirinda
    - Fanta
