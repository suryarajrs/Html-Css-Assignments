# CSS Flexbox Layout Styling Project

### Objective:
Create a visually appealing flexbox layout with specific dimensions, borders, and background colors for both the container (`outer-box`) and its child elements (`inner-box`).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Task Requirements**

### 1. **Outer Container (`outer-box`)**
   - **Dimensions**: `450px` by `450px`
   - **Border**: `7px` solid, with color `rgb(55, 125, 235)`
   - **Padding**: `25px` inside the box to give space around its content
   - **Positioning**:
     - Positioned `50px` from the top
     - Centered horizontally within its container
   - **Background Color**: `rgb(235, 235, 240)`
   - **Layout**:
     - Styled as a **flex container** to allow child elements (`inner-box`) to align according to flex properties

### 2. **Inner Elements (`inner-box`)**
   - **Dimensions**: `130px` height and `112px` width
   - **Border**: `4px` solid, with color `rgb(230, 60, 105)`
   - **Spacing**: `15px` between each `inner-box` element
   - **Alignment**:
     - Centered alphabet within each box using `align-items: center` and `justify-content: center`
   - **Background Color**: `rgb(250, 250, 255)`

## ðŸ“˜ **Usage Notes**
- **Flexbox Layout**:
  - The `outer-box` serves as the flex container, positioning its `inner-box` children centrally and with equal spacing between them.
- **Styling Details**:
  - The use of **consistent colors and spacing** provides visual cohesion.
  - Center alignment ensures each box is focused on its content, making the layout user-friendly and visually structured.
