# 🍕 Domino's Feedback Form

We at **Domino's** serve a variety of delicious pizzas, but we realized that collecting feedback from our customers is crucial for improving our service! That’s why we need your help in building a **feedback form**.

### 📝 Requirements

The feedback form should contain the following input fields:

- **Text input** (`#text`): for the customer's name (**required**).
- **Textarea** (`#message`): for feedback (**required**).
- **Email input** (`#email`): for the customer's email (**required**).
- **Number input** (`#rate`): to rate the service (range: `0-5`).
- **Submit button** (`#submit`): to send the feedback.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Each input field must have a corresponding label with the `id` format `{inputid}-label`.  
  For example:
  - The label for `#text` should have the `id` **`text-label`**.
  - The label for `#rate` should have the `id` **`rate-label`**.
